# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing 🧼

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's groundbreaking discovery that handwashing significantly reduces mortality rates in hospitals. By examining historical data from Vienna General Hospital, this project demonstrates the dramatic impact of handwashing on patient outcomes.

## Overview 📊

Dr. Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, discovered in the 1840s that handwashing could drastically reduce the incidence of childbed fever, a deadly disease affecting postpartum women. Despite facing resistance from the medical community, his discovery laid the foundation for modern infection control practices.

In this analysis, we explore historical data to visualize and quantify the effect of handwashing on mortality rates. The project includes:

- 📈 Loading and preprocessing historical datasets.
- 📉 Calculating and plotting proportions of deaths before and after the introduction of handwashing.
- 🧪 Performing a bootstrap analysis to estimate the confidence interval of the reduction in deaths.
